    **peril**

This is the scene where our heroes get their quest in the bar.

"Beware, young adventurers," croaked the old quest-giver. "The road you must travel is full of **peril**!"

"Why did you pronounce 'peril' that way, quest-giver?" Bob asked.

"I said '**peril**,' not 'peril,'" the old quest-giver snapped. "They're very different things!"

"But how, quest-giver?" Alice protested.

"You will learn that soon enough, young adventurer," the old quest-giver replied, and vanished into the darkness.
